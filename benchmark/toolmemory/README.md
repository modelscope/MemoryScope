### Overview

This folder archives **ExpG**, a tool-use enhancement built on [Agentscope ReMe](https://github.com/agentscope-ai/ReMe). ExpG mines, distills, and reuses experience from historical tool calls to provide **capability boundaries** and **best-practice guidance**, which helps agents:

- Select and invoke tools more robustly under dynamic or noisy environments;
- Let smaller models with guidance outperform larger, memoryless baselines;
- Improve consistently across tool selection, tool calling, and response generation.

**How ReMe is used:** Start the Tool Memory service; historical tool calls are written and evaluated via `add_tool_call_result`, distilled into tool-level guidance via `summary_tool_memory`, then retrieved and injected into later reasoning via `retrieve_tool_memory`. ReMe provides the vector store and service APIs; the acquisition / distillation / reuse strategy is implemented by ExpG. Full implementation and experiments are in [WangCan1178/ExpG](https://github.com/WangCan1178/ExpG).

### ExpG Mechanism

ExpG treats tool invocations as learnable experience and runs a three-stage pipeline:

1. **Experience Acquisition**
   - Analyze invocation quality from historical trajectories (success/failure, cost, latency, etc.);
   - Build structured experience units per tool, recording context, parameter patterns, and outcomes.

2. **Experience Distillation**
   - Filter noisy or unhelpful experiences and keep representative patterns;
   - Aggregate by equivalence classes to cover common and rare failure modes;
   - Summarize with an LLM into generalizable textual guidance.

3. **Experience Reuse**
   - Retrieve relevant experience / guidance for future tasks;
   - Inject guidance into tool selection, argument generation, and response synthesis;
   - Improve stability under dynamic environments and imperfect feedback.

# BEAM Benchmark

BEAM is a benchmark for **memory capability over long-context chat cases**. Each
case contains a very long chat history split into batches; ReMe converts each
batch into a session, ingests them in chronological order, then answers probing
questions via an agentic (ReAct) mode. Answers are scored with BEAM's
rubric-based `answer_judge` job, which produces both a graded score and a binary
verdict, and per-type averages are reported.

BEAM ships dataset variants by chat size — `100K` / `500K` / `1M` / `10M` — so
memory systems can be stressed at different context lengths. Question types
include abstention, contradiction resolution, event ordering, information
extraction, instruction following, knowledge update, multi-session reasoning,
preference following, summarization, and temporal reasoning.

Install ReMe and the BEAM plugin in editable mode from the repository root:

```bash
python -m pip install -e ".[as]"
reme plugins install ./plugins/beam --editable
reme plugins validate beam
```

The runner explicitly enables the installed `beam` plugin and combines its defaults with
ReMe's built-in `benchmark` preset. Editable installation keeps changes under
[`plugins/beam`](../../plugins/beam/README.md) visible without reinstalling the plugin.
Custom application config paths still work through `reme.config` and can use `extends: benchmark`.
This directory continues to own the runner, evaluation settings, dataset and outputs.
Model credentials use the environment variables declared by the shared benchmark configuration.

## 1. Get the Dataset

BEAM is a public repository, cloned into `benchmark/beam/dataset/`:

```bash
mkdir -p benchmark/beam/dataset
cd benchmark/beam/dataset
git clone https://github.com/mohammadtavakoli78/BEAM.git
```

After cloning, `benchmark/beam/dataset/BEAM/` should contain `chats/`, `src/`,
`topics/` and other subdirectories.

## 2. Run

From the repository root:

```bash
python benchmark/beam/run.py
python benchmark/beam/run.py --config benchmark/beam/config.yaml
python benchmark/beam/run.py -q                        # quiet
python benchmark/beam/run.py --eval_only               # reuse existing workspaces, query + judge only
```

## 3. Pipeline

1. For each case, load `chat.json` and convert each batch into a ReMe session.
2. Ingest sessions in chronological order into an isolated workspace, then `digest_update`.
3. Answer each probing question via agentic (ReAct) mode.
4. Score answers with BEAM's rubric-based `answer_judge` job and print per-type averages.

## 4. Key config — `benchmark/beam/config.yaml`

| Key | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `dataset.beam_root` | BEAM dataset root (`benchmark/beam/dataset/BEAM`). |
| `dataset.chat_size` | Variant to run: `100K` / `500K` / `1M` / `10M`. |
| `dataset.case_ids` | Specific cases (e.g. `["1","2"]`); empty = all cases. |
| `dataset.start_index` / `num_items` | Case pagination (`num_items` `0` = all). |
| `dataset.workspace_root` | Per-case workspace root (`benchmark/beam/workspaces/beam`). |
| `evaluation.num_workers` | `0` = auto, `1` = sequential, `>1` = parallel. |
| `reme.config` | ReMe config used (`benchmark`). |
| `output.dir` | Results directory (`benchmark/beam/results`). |

## 5. Outputs

Results are JSON files written to `output.dir` as
`results_<chat_size>_<timestamp>.json`, with a per-type score summary also
printed to the console. Logging conventions are shared across benchmarks — see
the [top-level README](../README.md#outputs--logs).

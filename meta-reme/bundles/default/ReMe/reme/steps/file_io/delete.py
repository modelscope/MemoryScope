"""``file_delete`` — hard-delete a file or folder under the workspace (reports inbound refs).

Removes the file (or folder tree) from disk; the watcher then prunes
the affected chunks from all projections (vector / keyword / file_graph).
For **soft** deletion that keeps a file addressable, use
``property_update(status=archived)`` instead — that's the path
structure.md's Decay algorithm is designed around.

Reference reporting (no auto-fix). Before deleting, the inbound
wikilink count for each doomed ``.md`` file is captured from the
file_graph's reverse index (literal full-path matching, same rule
as the wikilink retarget helper). For folder deletes, sources that live inside
the same folder are filtered out — those links die alongside the
delete and can't surface as dangling. The remaining inbound list
is the agent's punch list for follow-up rewrites.

The delete itself is unconditional: this step does not rewrite
inbound references on the agent's behalf because there is no
canonical "new target" — the agent decides per-reference whether
to rewrite (via ``file_move`` to a merge target), edit the
citing prose, or accept dangling.

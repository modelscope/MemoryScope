"""Shared tool_context-scoped chunk dedup with TTL.

Used by ``search_v2``/``vector_search``/``bm25_search`` to avoid returning the
same content twice within one agent tool_context. Per-context state lives at
``app_context.metadata["tool_contexts"][tool_context_id]["search_seen_chunk_ranges"]``
as ``{path: [(start_line, end_line, timestamp), ...]}``; a chunk is skipped when
its ``[start_line, end_line]`` is fully covered by the union of seen entries
(merged overlapping/adjacent intervals) for the same ``path``. Entries older
than ``seen_ttl_hours`` are expired on each call.
When ``app_context`` is absent the same structure is mirrored under
``self.kwargs["tool_contexts"][tool_context_id]`` for unit tests.

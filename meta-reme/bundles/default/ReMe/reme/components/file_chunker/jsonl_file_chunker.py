    """Chunker for JSONL (JSON Lines) files.

    Each line is treated as an atomic unit — splits are always on line
    boundaries.  A sliding window with configurable overlap produces
    consecutive chunks.

    Algorithm
    ---------
    1. From ``start``, greedily accumulate lines until adding the next line
       would exceed ``max_chars`` or ``max_lines_per_chunk`` → emit that chunk.
    2. From the *end* of the emitted chunk, walk backwards to find the
       maximum number of trailing lines whose combined size fits within
       ``max_overlap_chars`` → those lines become the start of the next chunk.
    3. Repeat until the entire file is covered.

    The size metric can be switched between **character count** (default)
    and **byte count** via the ``mode`` parameter.

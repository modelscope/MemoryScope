# Auto Dream

`auto_dream` is ReMe's long-term memory distillation flow from daily to digest. By default it scans the target date and
the previous day, processes only files changed since the previous dream, extracts a small set of high-value memory units
across that window, integrates them into `digest/`, and writes the target day's `interests.yaml` for proactive use.

</p>

Its daily inputs usually come from [Auto Memory](./auto_memory.md) and [Auto Resource](./auto_resource.md). For the file
semantics of `digest/`, Sources sections, and wikilinks, see [Memory as File](./memory_as_file.md). For the linking
strategy used during Integrate, see [Auto Link](./auto_link.md). To read `interests.yaml`,
use [Proactive](./proactive.md).

## Configuration

The default configuration is in `reme/config/default.yaml`:

```yaml
auto_dream:
  backend: base
  parameters:
    date:
      type: string
      default: ""
    hint:
      type: string
      default: ""
    scan_days:
      type: integer
      default: 2
    max_units:
      type: integer
      default: 5
  steps:
    - backend: dream_extract_step
      file_catalog: dream
      topic_session_id: interests
      scan_days: 2
      max_units: 5
    - backend: dream_integrate_step
    - backend: dream_finish_step
      file_catalog: dream
```

Parameters:

| Parameter              | Purpose                                                                                                 |
|------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `date`                 | Date to process in `YYYY-MM-DD` format. When empty, use today in the application's timezone.            |
| `hint`                 | Additional guidance from the caller for the Extract and Integrate stages.                               |
| `scan_days`            | Recent-date window ending at `date`; defaults to 2 and has a minimum of 1.                              |
| `max_units`            | Maximum reusable units extracted in one run; defaults to 5.                                             |

## Inputs and Outputs

Inputs are daily Markdown files from the most recent `scan_days` ending at the specified date. For example,
`date=2026-06-20` with `scan_days=2` scans:

```text
daily/2026-06-19.md
daily/2026-06-19/**/*.md
daily/2026-06-20.md
daily/2026-06-20/**/*.md
```

Every `daily/<date>/interests.yaml` in the scan window is excluded from extraction so previous proactive output cannot
feed back into the next run. Final topics are written only for the target date.

The main outputs are:

| Output                         | Description                                                                  |
|--------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `digest/procedure/*.md`        | Methods, workflows, runbooks, and executable experience.                     |
| `digest/personal/*.md`         | User-, team-, and project-related preferences, facts, and long-term context. |
| `digest/wiki/*.md`             | General knowledge, concepts, observations, and decision precedents.          |
| `daily/<date>/interests.yaml`  | Topics worth proactive attention from the host agent that day.               |
| `metadata/file_catalog/dream*` | Dream-specific catalog used to detect changes in daily inputs.               |

## Four Stages

### 1. Extract

`dream_extract_step` performs three tasks:

1. Refresh each `daily/<date>.md` in the scan window.
2. Scan those day indexes and `daily/<date>/**/*.md`, comparing mtimes with `file_catalog: dream`.
3. Send all changed files together to the LLM and globally extract two structured result types: `units` and `topics`.

`units` are long-term memory units ready to be distilled into digest. Each has `name`, `bucket`, `summary`, and `paths`.
A run returns at most `max_units`; extraction merges cross-file evidence for the same abstraction and drops passing
mentions, per-file summaries, and weak candidates without reusable value. `bucket` may only be `procedure`, `personal`,
or `wiki`; unknown values are routed to `wiki`.

`topics` are proactive-interest candidates for the day. They contain `title`, `reason`, `evidence`, `keywords`, and
`paths` and are filtered again in the Topics stage.

If there are no changed files, Extract succeeds with no units; Integrate then has no unit work, Topics preserves any
existing target-day topics, and Finish still performs its normal catalog summary. If files changed but no LLM is
configured, Extract fails because extraction requires an LLM.

### 2. Integrate

`dream_integrate_step` invokes an agent independently for each unit and integrates that unit into one digest node. It
exposes these tools to the agent:

```text
node_search, read, frontmatter_read, write, edit, frontmatter_update
```

This stage carries the core responsibility of `auto_link`. It first uses `node_search` to recall similar or related
nodes at digest-node granularity, decides whether to create or update a node, and finally writes sources and related
digest nodes as wikilinks. See [Auto Link](./auto_link.md) for the recall, deduplication, and edge-writing rules.

Extract is the gate for deciding whether material is worth remembering, so Integrate has no `SKIP` action: each admitted
unit must land in exactly one digest node. Creates and updates must retain provenance and weave related digest links
into contextual sentences; bare wikilinks and standalone relationship fields are not valid output.

There are four integration actions:

| Action        | Meaning                                                                        |
|---------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `CREATE`      | No equivalent abstraction exists; create a new digest node.                    |
| `CORROBORATE` | The same memory appeared again; append a source or strengthen the description. |
| `REFINE`      | New material adds boundaries, steps, prerequisites, applicability, or detail.  |
| `CORRECT`     | New material corrects errors, omissions, or conflicts in the existing node.    |

Successfully integrated units are recorded in `integrate_results`. Failed units enter `failed_units`, and their source
paths enter `failed_paths`. The Finish stage does not checkpoint failed paths, ensuring that they can be retried later.

### 3. Finish

`dream_finish_step` completes the run:

1. Write successfully processed changed paths to `file_catalog: dream`.
2. Also write every refreshed day-index page in the scan window to the catalog.
3. Persist the dream catalog if there were upserts or deletions.
4. Return a summary containing counts for scanned, changed, integrated, checkpoints, and related values.

`interests.yaml` is no longer written by auto dream. The daytime exposure file is owned by
`proactive_refresh_cron`; see [Proactive](./proactive.md). Dream only reads historical `interests.yaml` files as
extraction material.

Failed paths are not checkpointed. The next `auto_dream` run therefore continues to treat them as changed inputs until
integration succeeds.

## Running Auto Dream

CLI:

```bash
reme auto_dream date=2026-06-20
```

With caller guidance:

```bash
reme auto_dream date=2026-06-20 hint="Prioritize engineering decisions and long-term preferences"
```

Override the default scan window and unit cap:

```bash
reme auto_dream date=2026-06-20 scan_days=3 max_units=8
```

The same set of steps can also be placed in a `cron` Job, for example to run every morning:

```yaml
jobs:
  daily_auto_dream:
    backend: cron
    cron: "30 3 * * *"
    steps:
      - backend: dream_extract_step
        file_catalog: dream
      - backend: dream_integrate_step
      - backend: dream_finish_step
        file_catalog: dream
```

## Important Boundaries

`auto_dream` consumes only daily inputs and does not rewrite daily bodies. Daily preserves facts and the original
situation; digest is the abstracted long-term memory layer.

`digest` is not a copy of the source text. Its body should preserve reusable abstractions, while a Sources section
points back with contextual sentences such as `The decision was recorded in [[daily/<date>/decision.md]].` Links follow
the workspace-relative wikilink semantics described in
[Memory as File](./memory_as_file.md).

`auto_dream` does not invent an overview from nothing. Only content that actually appears in daily input and is
extracted as a unit or topic can enter digest or `interests.yaml`.

The complete flow depends on an LLM for Extract and Integrate. Topics can perform local deduplication without an LLM,
but that does not mean the full dream flow can run offline.

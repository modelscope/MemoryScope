# Auto Link

In the current implementation, `auto_link` is not a separately registered Job. It is a capability of the Integrate stage
in
`auto_dream`: when `dream_integrate_step` writes a memory unit to `digest/`, it also recalls digest nodes, makes a
deduplication decision, links sources, and weaves wikilinks to related nodes into the result.

For the complete dream flow, see [Auto Dream](./auto_dream.md). For general wikilink, frontmatter, and
workspace-relative path semantics, see [Memory as File](./memory_as_file.md). For question-answering retrieval, see
[Memory Search](./memory_search.md).

## Where It Runs

The default `auto_dream` flow is:

```yaml
auto_dream:
  steps:
    - dream_extract_step
    - dream_integrate_step   # where auto_link actually happens
    - dream_finish_step
```

The Integrate stage processes each unit independently. A unit is written to exactly one target digest node, but that
node may link to multiple sources and multiple related digest nodes.

## Goals

`auto_link` addresses graph quality at write time:

| Problem                                        | Handling                                                             |
|------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| The same memory already exists                 | Recall and update the existing node instead of creating a duplicate. |
| New and existing material are related          | Write workspace-relative wikilinks into the body.                    |
| A digest node is disconnected from its sources | Add daily/resource links under a `## Sources` section.               |
| A node contains only isolated prose            | Add links to related digest nodes on both CREATE and UPDATE.         |

## Toolchain

`dream_integrate_step` exposes these tools to the agent:

```text
node_search
read
frontmatter_read
write
edit
frontmatter_update
```

`node_search` is digest-only node retrieval designed for dream integration. It returns node-level signals such as the
digest node's `path` and the `name` and `description` from frontmatter. It does not expand the body and does not perform
the link expansion used by ordinary search.

`read` and `frontmatter_read` are used only for candidates that may be relevant, avoiding expansion of every recalled
result into a large context.

## Linking Flow

### 1. Recall candidate nodes

The agent first calls `node_search` with the unit's triggers, verbs, nouns, synonyms, and possible failure modes. Broad
recall, for example `limit=20-30`, is recommended by default because this step serves both deduplication and link
discovery.

Recalled results are internally classified into three groups:

| Classification     | Meaning                                                                                                 | Next action               |
|--------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|
| `same_abstraction` | The trigger or underlying abstraction is the same, with substantial content overlap.                    | Use as the UPDATE target. |
| `related`          | An adjacent process, prerequisite, failure mode, concept, preference, or upstream/downstream knowledge. | Write a body wikilink.    |
| `unrelated`        | Only superficially similar or unrelated.                                                                | Ignore.                   |

### 2. Choose a write action

Every unit must select one action:

| Action        | Linking semantics                                                                                                             |
|---------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `CREATE`      | Write a new `digest/<bucket>/<slug>.md` and add source and related-node links to its body.                                    |
| `CORROBORATE` | The same abstraction appeared again; append its source link and strengthen the description when needed.                       |
| `REFINE`      | New material extends the existing node; insert the additional content in the appropriate section and preserve existing links. |
| `CORRECT`     | New material corrects the existing node; use source links to identify the basis for the correction.                           |

An UPDATE should be additive whenever possible: do not delete existing wikilinks or source entries. This prevents later
graph indexing and retrieval from losing edges.

### 3. Write source edges

Source edges are ordinary wikilinks grouped under a Markdown heading:

```markdown
## Sources

The decision was recorded in [[daily/2026-06-20/session.md]], while the supporting technical evidence comes from
[[resource/2026-06-20/paper.md]].
```

These edges represent the evidence behind a digest node. Plain-text descriptions do not count as source edges because
only wikilinks can be parsed reliably by the file graph. The surrounding sentence must explain what each source
supports; a bare wikilink line is not valid Integrate output. For the complete parsing rules, see
[Memory as File](./memory_as_file.md#wikilink).

### 4. Write relationships between digest nodes

Relationships between digest nodes use complete workspace-relative paths woven into natural prose:

```markdown
This design extends [[digest/wiki/hybrid-search.md]] and uses
[[digest/procedure/rebuild-index.md]]. Follow
[[digest/personal/team-review-preference.md]] during review.
```

## Bucket Differences

`auto_link` adjusts the shape of its output according to the unit bucket:

| Bucket      | Writing focus                                                                                                               |
|-------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `procedure` | Write a runbook with triggers, steps, inputs, and failure modes. Link prerequisites, substeps, and related preferences.     |
| `personal`  | Write user-, team-, or project-specific facts and preferences. Link related projects, habits, and decision context.         |
| `wiki`      | Write general knowledge, principles, observations, and decision precedents. Link concepts, methods, and adjacent knowledge. |

Regardless of bucket, preserve source edges and weave recalled related digest nodes into the body whenever possible.

## Relationship to Search

`auto_link` uses `node_search`, not the question-answering `search`.

| Capability    | Purpose                                                                                                   |
|---------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `search`      | External question answering; returns chunks and can expand upstream/downstream link context.              |
| `node_search` | Dream integration; recalls only digest node-level summaries for deduplication and related-link decisions. |

This boundary matters. The Integrate stage needs to decide whether the same abstraction already exists and which nodes
should be linked; it should not load large numbers of body chunks into context. [Memory Search](./memory_search.md)
handles question-oriented chunk retrieval, RRF fusion, and link expansion.

## Failure and Retry

If integration of a unit fails, `dream_integrate_step` records `failed_units` and `failed_paths`.
`dream_finish_step` does not checkpoint those source paths, so the next `auto_dream` run processes them again.

This makes auto_link writes retryable: a failure does not mark the input as complete or silently discard digest edges
that should have been created.

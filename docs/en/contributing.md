## How to Contribute

Thank you for your interest in ReMe. ReMe is a file-first, self-evolving memory system for agents. Contributions are
welcome through issue reports, documentation improvements, additional tests, bug fixes, and new capabilities.

If this is your first time running ReMe locally, start with [Quick Start](./quick_start.md). If your change affects
runtime layers, Jobs, Steps, or components, read [ReMe Framework](./framework.md). If it affects workspace directories,
frontmatter, wikilinks, or chunking, read [Memory as File](./memory_as_file.md).

### 1. Before You Begin

Before investing in an implementation:

- Check [Open Issues](https://github.com/agentscope-ai/ReMe/issues) for an existing issue or discussion.
- If a related issue is still open, comment that you would like to work on it to avoid duplicate effort.
- If no issue exists, create one describing the context, expected behavior, possible implementation, and scope of
  impact.
- For larger feature changes, align with maintainers on interfaces, configuration, compatibility, and test strategy
  before submitting an implementation.

### 2. Local Development Environment

The core ReMe code is located in:

- `reme/`: Python package source, including configuration, components, services, Jobs, Steps, schemas, and utilities.
- `pyproject.toml`: project metadata, dependencies, optional dependencies, command entry points, and test configuration.
- `tests/`: unit and integration tests.

The project requires Python 3.11 or later. A virtual environment is recommended:

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e reme_studio -e ".[dev,full]"
cd reme_studio
npm ci
npm run build:static
cd ..
pre-commit install
```

### 3. Development Model

Before developing ReMe code, read [ReMe Framework](./framework.md). New or modified core capabilities should follow the
layers and call chain described there:

```text
CLI / Client -> Service -> Application -> Job -> Step -> Component / Workspace
```

In practice:

- Capabilities exposed to users or external systems should normally be orchestrated by a Job, then exposed by a Service
  as a CLI-, HTTP-, or MCP-callable interface.
- Reusable infrastructure belongs in `reme/components/`, with dependencies declared through `BaseComponent.bind()`.
- Atomic business operations belong in `reme/steps/` and access the file store, agent wrapper, catalog, LLM, and other
  components through `BaseStep.Ref`.
- Request, response, and persistent data structures belong in `reme/schema/` or `reme/enumeration/`. Do not scatter
  implicit structures through Step implementations.
- Configuration-driven defaults belong in `reme/config/default.yaml`, and the default configuration must remain runnable
  and testable.

When adding a Step or Job, pay particular attention to these conventions:

- Register implementations with `@R.register("<backend_name>")`. Registration names should be stable, clear, and match
  the configured `backend`.
- After adding a Step file, make sure its package `__init__.py` imports the module; otherwise, the registry will not
  load it.
- A Step should perform one atomic business operation. Cross-step flows belong in Job configuration or a dedicated
  orchestration Step.
- A Job composes Steps and selects normal, streaming, background, or scheduled execution. `enable_serve` controls
  whether it is externally exposed.
- When a Step needs components, prefer `BaseStep.Ref`. Do not reconstruct global components inside a Step or bypass
  `ApplicationContext`.
- File, index, graph, frontmatter, and wikilink behavior must preserve consistent workspace-relative path semantics.
- Add fast tests under `tests/unit/` for new capabilities. Put cross-component, LLM, embedding, or service behavior
  under
  `tests/integration/` when appropriate.

### 4. Code and Documentation Changes

Choose the appropriate entry point for the type of change:

| Change type                       | Primary location                                      | Guidance                                                                                                                                |
|-----------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Configuration or startup behavior | `reme/config/`, `reme/application.py`, `reme/reme.py` | Keep the default configuration runnable and avoid breaking existing CLI, HTTP, and MCP entry points.                                    |
| Component capability              | `reme/components/`                                    | Reuse `BaseComponent`, the registry, and context objects.                                                                               |
| Job or Step                       | `reme/components/job/`, `reme/steps/`                 | Follow the Job -> Step model in [ReMe Framework](./framework.md), keep request and response schemas clear, and add corresponding tests. |
| Data structure                    | `reme/schema/`, `reme/enumeration/`                   | Preserve serialization compatibility and existing frontmatter and wikilink semantics.                                                   |
| Utility                           | `reme/utils/`                                         | Keep function boundaries small and cover edge cases with unit tests.                                                                    |
| User documentation                | `docs/en/`, `README.md`                               | Update documentation when user-visible behavior changes.                                                                                |

If a change involves an LLM, embeddings, an external service, file watching, or a background task, also describe its
dependencies, failure behavior, and local validation method.

### 5. Commit Message Format

Use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) to keep history clear.

Format:

```text
<type>(<scope>): <subject>
```

Common types:

- `feat`: new feature
- `fix`: bug fix
- `docs`: documentation only
- `style`: code-style change with no behavior change
- `refactor`: refactoring that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- `perf`: performance improvement
- `test`: add or update tests
- `chore`: build, tooling, or maintenance work

Examples:

```bash
feat(search): add link expansion option
fix(file-graph): handle pending wikilinks after move
docs(memory): update auto memory guide
test(config): cover default yaml parsing
chore(pre-commit): update lint hooks
```

### 6. Pull Request Titles

PR titles should use the same format:

```text
<type>(<scope>): <description>
```

Requirements:

- Use `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `test`, `refactor`, `chore`, `perf`, `style`, `build`, or `revert` as the type.
- Use lowercase letters, numbers, hyphens, or underscores for the scope.
- Keep the description short and state the actual effect of the PR.

Examples:

```text
feat(auto-memory): persist source conversation metadata
fix(markdown): keep wikilink aliases during edit
docs(en): add contribution guide
```

### 7. Pre-submit Checks

Before committing or opening a PR, run at least:

```bash
pre-commit run --all-files
pytest
```

For a localized code change, start with a narrower test set:

```bash
pytest tests/unit/test_search_step.py
pytest tests/unit/test_reme_cli.py
```

If `pre-commit` modifies files automatically, commit those changes and rerun the checks until everything passes.

The current pre-commit configuration includes YAML/TOML/JSON validation, private-key detection, trailing-whitespace
checks,
`black`, `flake8`, `pylint`, and `pyroma`. The main formatting rules are:

- `black --line-length=120`
- `flake8 --max-line-length=120`
- `pylint --max-line-length=120`

Some integration tests may require an LLM, embeddings, or external service configuration. If you cannot run them
locally, state why they were skipped and what alternative validation you completed in the PR description.

### 8. Testing Requirements

Add tests according to the risk of the change:

- For a bug fix, first add a regression test that reproduces the issue.
- For a new Step, Job, or component, cover at least the main path and a failure path.
- For changes to shared logic such as indexes, graphs, wikilinks, frontmatter, or file operations, add edge cases.
- For changes to the CLI, services, or configuration parsing, cover the user-visible entry point.
- Documentation-only changes usually do not require new tests, but running `pre-commit run --all-files` is still
  recommended.

Place tests according to the existing structure:

- `tests/unit/`: fast tests that require no real external service.
- `tests/integration/`: integration tests spanning components or requiring external configuration.

### 9. Documentation Contributions

When a change affects how users install, configure, invoke, or understand ReMe, update the documentation as well.

Documentation lives under:

```text
docs/
```

User guides should have matching `docs/zh/` and `docs/en/` versions and appear in the corresponding navigation in
`docs/.vitepress/config.mts`. The ReMe Studio, TypeScript, plugin, and benchmark READMEs remain canonical in their own
directories; `github-pages/scripts/generate-content.mjs` mirrors them during builds. Never edit `.generated/` or `dist/`.

The Job API reference is generated from `reme/config/default.yaml`. Update that YAML and its tests when a default Job
contract changes rather than editing generated pages.

Documentation should:

- Use clear titles that directly identify a capability or flow.
- Provide commands that can be copied and run.
- Use real repository paths such as `reme/config/default.yaml`, `reme/steps/`, and `tests/unit/`.
- Describe default behavior according to the current code, `pyproject.toml`, and default configuration.

Validate the documentation site with:

```bash
cd github-pages
npm ci
npm test
npm run build
```

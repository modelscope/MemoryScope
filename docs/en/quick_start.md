description: Install and start ReMe, then complete a first file, retrieval, and automatic-memory workflow.

# Quick Start

This page gets one working loop running. See [Configuration](./configuration.md) for the full configuration contract and [Services and Deployment](./services.md) for HTTP or MCP integration.

## Installation

ReMe requires Python 3.11+.

Install from pip:

```bash
pip install "reme-ai[core]"
```

Install from source:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/agentscope-ai/ReMe.git
cd ReMe
pip install -e reme_studio -e ".[core]"
cd reme_studio
npm ci
npm run build:static
cd ..
```

The static build step requires Node.js 22.13 or newer and makes Studio available when running ReMe from the source tree.

Installing the `core` extra is recommended. The current code imports the AgentScope wrapper, and self-evolving memory
also depends on it.

To use agent workflows such as `auto_memory`, `auto_resource`, and `auto_dream`, configure an LLM:

```bash
cat > .env <<'EOF'
LLM_BACKEND=openai
LLM_MODEL_NAME=qwen3.7-plus
LLM_API_KEY=your_api_key
LLM_BASE_URL=https://dashscope.aliyuncs.com/compatible-mode/v1
EOF
```

You can initially omit the LLM configuration if you only need basic file operations and BM25 retrieval.

---

## Start the Service

```bash
reme start
```

The default service address is `127.0.0.1:2333`. If the port is already in use:

```bash
reme start service.port=8181
```

```bash
reme version
reme health_check
reme help
```

`reme help` lists server actions. Ordinary commands invoke server Jobs over HTTP.

The base `reme-ai` package does not include frontend assets. Install `reme-ai[web]` or `reme-ai[core]`, then open
<http://127.0.0.1:2333/> for ReMe Studio. It uses the same service to
browse, edit, and search the workspace and inspect the digest wikilink graph. Disable it with
`service.web_enabled=false`, or provide a custom build with `service.web_static_dir` / `REME_WEB_STATIC_DIR`. The Job
API still starts if no web build is found.

---

## Workspace Layout

The default workspace is `.reme/` under the current directory. It is created automatically at startup:

```text
.reme/
├── metadata/   # persistent indexes, graph, catalogs, and related state
├── session/    # source conversation records
├── mem_session/ # generated Agent wrapper sessions/config
├── resource/   # external resources
├── daily/      # daily notes
└── digest/     # long-term memory
```

For directory layers, Markdown frontmatter, and wikilink semantics, see
[Memory as File](./memory_as_file.md).

You can also specify the workspace at startup:

```bash
reme start workspace_dir=/tmp/reme-demo service.port=8181
```

---

## Write, Index, and Search

```bash
reme write \
  path=digest/wiki/quick-start-demo \
  name="Quick Start Demo" \
  description="Example memory for the quick start" \
  content="# Quick Start Demo

The default live watcher indexes Markdown under the daily and digest directories.

Related link: [[digest/wiki/search-demo.md]]"
```

`path` is relative to the workspace. A missing suffix is automatically completed with `.md`. For Markdown files, `name`
and
`description` are written to frontmatter.

The background watcher ingests workspace files automatically. You can manually rebuild the derived BM25 and embedding
indexes from the chunks it has already ingested:

```bash
reme reindex
```

This command does not scan workspace files, rechunk content, or rebuild the wikilink graph.

Search:

```bash
reme search query="quick start example memory" limit=5
```

Read:

```bash
reme read path=digest/wiki/quick-start-demo start_line=1 end_line=20
```

With the default configuration, retrieval is primarily BM25 plus wikilink graph expansion. Vector retrieval is supported
by the code, but the embedding store is disabled by default. For the full retrieval flow, see
[Memory Search](./memory_search.md).

## Files and Daily Notes

```bash
reme stat path=digest/wiki/quick-start-demo
reme edit path=digest/wiki/quick-start-demo old="indexes" new="continuously indexes"
reme frontmatter_read path=digest/wiki/quick-start-demo
reme frontmatter_update path=digest/wiki/quick-start-demo metadata='{"tags":["demo"]}'
```

The file-listing Job can be called directly from the CLI:

```bash
reme list path=digest recursive=true limit=50
```

The equivalent HTTP call is:

```bash
curl -s http://127.0.0.1:2333/list \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"path":"digest","recursive":true,"limit":50}'
```

Daily notes:

```bash
reme write path=daily/2026-06-20/demo-session.md name=demo-session description="Demo session" content="Recorded content"
reme daily_list
reme daily_reindex
```

`write` can create a daily note directly. Run `daily_reindex` when the day's index needs to be refreshed.

---

## Automatic Memory

```bash
reme auto_memory \
  session_id=chat-demo \
  messages='[{"role":"user","content":"I prefer to preserve project experience as Markdown."},{"role":"assistant","content":"Recorded."}]' \
  memory_hint="Record the user's preference"
```

After placing external material under `resource/YYYY-MM-DD/` or directly under `resource/`, the default background task
watches
`md/txt/json/jsonl/csv/yaml/html`. You can also trigger processing manually:

```bash
reme auto_resource changes='[{"path":"resource/2026-06-20/report.md","change":"added"}]'
```

Distill daily notes into long-term digest memory:

```bash
reme auto_dream date=2026-06-20
reme proactive date=2026-06-20
```

These flows require a working LLM. Without an LLM configuration, start with basic capabilities such as `write`, `read`,
and
`search`.

For more detail, see [Auto Memory](./auto_memory.md), [Auto Resource](./auto_resource.md),
[Auto Dream](./auto_dream.md), and [Proactive](./proactive.md).

## HTTP and Configuration

Every service-enabled Job is exposed as `POST /<job>`:

```bash
curl -s http://127.0.0.1:2333/version \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{}'

curl -s http://127.0.0.1:2333/search \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"query":"quick start","limit":5}'
```

The default configuration comes from `reme/config/default.yaml`. Override it at startup with dot notation:

```bash
reme start \
  workspace_dir=/tmp/reme-demo \
  service.host=127.0.0.1 \
  service.port=8181 \
  enable_logo=false
```

You can also specify a YAML or JSON configuration file:

```bash
reme start config=/path/to/custom.yaml
```

Continue with the [CLI Reference](./reference/cli.md), [Job API Reference](./reference/jobs.md), or [Diagnostics, Backup, and Recovery](./operations.md).

description: Run ReMe through HTTP, SSE, MCP, the CLI, and ReMe Studio while respecting its local security boundary.

# Services and Deployment

ReMe can run as a local HTTP service, a standalone MCP server, or a one-shot CLI Job. The default starts HTTP on `127.0.0.1:2333` and serves JSON, SSE, streamable HTTP MCP, and optional ReMe Studio from one process.

## HTTP API

```bash
reme start
reme start service.host=127.0.0.1 service.port=8181
```

Regular Jobs become `POST /<job-name>`:

```bash
curl -s http://127.0.0.1:2333/search \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"query":"user preferences","limit":5}'
```

Job arguments live at the request body's top level. A regular response follows the `Response` schema:

```json
{"success": true, "answer": "...", "metadata": {}}
```

Unhandled Step failures become unsuccessful responses.

## Streaming and SSE

Jobs with `backend: stream` also use `POST /<job-name>`, returning `text/event-stream`. Error paths emit an error chunk and always terminate the stream. The default `chat` Job is streaming:

```bash
curl -N http://127.0.0.1:2333/chat \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"query":"Summarize my long-term preferences"}'
```

MCP does not expose Stream Jobs.

## MCP

The default HTTP service mounts streamable HTTP MCP at `/mcp`:

```yaml
service:
  backend: http
  mcp_enabled: true
  mcp_path: /mcp
  mcp_stateless_http: false
```

For a standalone MCP service:

```bash
reme start service.backend=mcp service.transport=stdio
reme start service.backend=mcp service.transport=sse service.port=2333
reme start service.backend=mcp service.transport=streamable-http service.port=2333
```

MCP tools come from non-stream Jobs with `enable_serve: true`. Use `service.jobs` as an allowlist. `injected_job_kwargs` adds server-managed values that callers cannot override.

```yaml
service:
  backend: http
  jobs: [search, read, traverse, auto_memory]
  injected_job_kwargs:
    tenant_id: local-user
  tool_error_on_failure: true
```

## ReMe Studio

After installing `reme-ai[web]` or `reme-ai[core]`, the default HTTP origin also serves Studio:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:2333/
```

Disable it with `service.web_enabled=false` or select a build with `service.web_static_dir`. Missing static assets do not prevent the Job API from starting.

## One-shot Jobs

```bash
reme start job=search query="user preferences" limit=5
```

This selects the one-shot CLI Service while retaining the normal Application, Component, and Job lifecycle.

## Service discovery

```bash
reme find_reme
```

Ordinary `reme <action>` commands prefer the running service's actual backend, host, port, and transport. They fall back to local configuration only when no service is discovered.

## Security boundary

ReMe is local-first:

- the default binds to `127.0.0.1`;
- HTTP CORS allows any origin;
- Jobs may write, move, or delete files;
- the service layer has no general-purpose user authentication.

Do not expose the default service directly to the public internet. For remote access, place it on a controlled network or behind an authenticated TLS reverse proxy, apply access controls and request-size limits, and expose only necessary Jobs.

## OpenAPI

FastAPI exposes the active endpoints through `/docs`, `/redoc`, and `/openapi.json`. The Studio SPA fallback preserves these reserved paths.

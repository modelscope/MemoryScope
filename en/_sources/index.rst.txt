MemoryScope Documentation
=========================

Welcome to MemoryScope Tutorial

MemoryScope provides LLM chatbots with powerful and flexible long-term memory capabilities, offering a framework for building such abilities.
It can be applied to scenarios like personal assistants and emotional companions, continuously learning through long-term memory to remember users' basic information as well as various habits and preferences.
This allows users to gradually experience a sense of "understanding" when using the LLM.

Framework
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

üíæ Memory Database: MemoryScope is equipped with a vector database (default is *ElasticSearch*) to store all memory fragments recorded in the system.

üîß Worker Library: MemoryScope atomizes the capabilities of long-term memory into individual workers, including over 20 workers for tasks such as query information filtering, observation extraction, and insight updating.

üõ†Ô∏è Operation Library: Based on the worker pipeline, it constructs the operations for memory services, realizing key capabilities such as memory retrieval and memory consolidation.

- Memory Retrieval: Upon arrival of a user query, this operation returns the semantically related memory pieces
and/or those from the corresponding time if the query involves reference to time.
- Memory Consolidation: This operation takes in a batch of user queries and returns important user information
extracted from the queries as consolidated *observations* to be stored in the memory database.
- Reflection and Re-consolidation: At regular intervals, this operation performs reflection upon newly recorded *observations*
to form and update *insights*. Then, memory re-consolidation is performed to ensure contradictions and repetitions
among memory pieces are properly handled.
